# Ball and Beam control
The final project of the course Fundamentals of Automatic Controller Design, defined by Professor [Aria Alasti ](https://sharif.ir/~aalasti/)at Sharif University of Technology And it was carried out by me and my teammate Mohammad Javad Shamseddin Saeed
# Project Description
The Ball and Beam system is one of the most well-known and simplest control systems. This system includes a long beam that allows the ball to move inside it. The control objective in this system is to precisely control the position of the ball in the middle of the beam. For this purpose, an ultrasonic sensor is embedded to detect the position and speed of the ball at every moment, and a servo motor is placed in the middle or at the edges of the beam to generate rotational motion and control the position of the ball.
